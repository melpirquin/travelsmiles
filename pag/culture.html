            <h2>Amazing Jordanian Culture</h2>
            <p>Here we will talk about Jordan's Culture</p>
            <div class="clearfix">
                <p style="clear:right">The culture of Jordan is based in Arabic and Islamic elements. Jordan stands at
                    the intersection of
                    the three continents of the ancient world, lending it geographic and population diversity. Notable
                    aspects of the culture include traditional music and clothing of Jordan, and interest in sports.</p>

                     alt="jordan culture">
                <p>
                    Archeological evidence indicates that the area of Jordan was occupied by settlers as early as 7000
                    BC, which makes it home to captivating historical and biblical sites. Jordan offers a variety of
                    wonders, from vast desert, to the Dead Sea, to the ancient city of Petra.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jordanians typically respect those who are kind, friendly, and hospitable. They are generally
                    socially conservative; family values and honor are fiercely protected. Jordanians are proud of their
                    rich cultural heritage.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <div>
                    <span> <h2>Social interactions</h2></span>

                    <p>Social interaction in Jordan is replete with all kinds of seemingly impenetrable verbal and
                        behavioural
                        rituals, most of which can remain unaddressed by foreigners with impunity. A few things are
                        worth
                        knowing, however.</p>

                    <p>The energy which Jordanians put into social relationships can bring shame to westerners used to
                        keeping
                        a distance. Total strangers greet each other like chums and chat happily about nothing special,
                        passers-by ask each other’s advice or exchange opinions without a second thought, and old
                        friends embark
                        on volleys of salutations and cheek-kisses, joyful arm-squeezing or back-slapping, and earnest
                        enquiries
                        after health, family, business and news. Foreigners more used to avoiding strangers and doing
                        business
                        in shops quickly and impersonally can come across as cold, uninterested and even snooty.
                        Smiling,
                        learning one or two of the standard forms of greeting, acknowledging those who are welcoming you
                        and
                        taking the time to exchange pleasantries will bring you closer to people more quickly than
                        anything
                        else.</p>


                    <p> People shake hands in Jordan much more than in the West, and even the merest contact with a
                        stranger is
                        normally punctuated by at least one or two handshakes to indicate fraternity.</p>
